Tonight is the night for Ajax Amsterdam to make a massive statement to the European football world about their balance and quality as a side.  I would not be surprised to see them walk away 3-1 victors.

@jusinsider @rnz_news That is the reason why majority of us are vaccinated it is to protect others out there who like myself are high risk of Covid
@TheRickWilson Proportionate death rate comparisons from Covid between Canada and the US are not even comparable.  Canada has FAR FEWER deaths.  We actually don’t want our citizens dropping like flies behind a banner of so-called ‘freedom’.
"Well it looks like PUTIN is about to create a 2nd Russian Revolution as many Russian citizens oppose the invasion of The Ukraine.

@adamgurri In purely practical terms I think he's right.  Putin has made some clever moves so far and he has positioned himself well.  Imo it's best to separate morality from strategy as they don't tend to mix well.

Seriously? The liberals are all for show! That won’t even make Putin blink. Something with real teeth would be cut off the oil imports world wide, but that is a problem as we, who could have energy independence, have chosen to cut off our oil production to save the planet.

I have been fairly confident of a Biden comeback before the midterms.  My confidence is ebbing.  The accelerating oil price increase resulting from Ukraine is a disaster for the economy.  Sending more troops in support of NATO threatens to make Ukraine a Biden quagmire.

@juliettekayyem The only thing I worry about is Putin using Chernobyl as a bargaining chip. When he kept mentioning 'nuclear', most thought he meant weapons. But he could have very well meant a nuclear hostage in the form of a plant which could be sabotaged.
Ideally, we want this arsenal team to develop and be competing within a few years and then bring in a new generation of younger talent to back them up. Continue this cycle and we’ll be good.

@BernieSanders It was said about Putin that if you had a nicer house than his house, he would burn your house down. Putin must be a Democrat. They both hate capitalism. In the summer of love Dems conducted 574 mostly peaceful riots causing $2B in damage, 30 deaths, 1,000s of police injured.

Putin was expecting Ukraine to roll over. He wanted a quick, relatively bloodless victory to avoid even more opprobrium. Now it seems that if he wants Ukraine, he will have to fight for every inch of it. That's simply unsustainable.

@daveirl @FHeisbourg Turkey shot down a Russian aircraft. Did Putin threaten Erdogan will nuclear annihilation after it? Besides, I never said the no-fly zone should be a NATO operation (I think it shouldn't in fact).

Why would Putin even bother influencing our opinion now?"
truth is…NATO surrounds russia. in putins eyes that’s a threat of a potential invasion. if russia had colonies like mexico or canada who border america…guess what, biden would do exactly what putin is doing right now

@SpaghettiBeast @POTUS @dian_simplethin That all sounds very logical and if Putin hadn’t been planning this for years, I might even consider it a good strategy, but Putin knows how these things work. If he thought for a second having his money frozen would stop him, he would’ve waited.

We knew this would happen. Warfare has again transformed to match with the realities of technology. For Ukraine, civil-military fusion is a key objective when your attackers have more strength and resources than you.

@hbarndollar @BenVolin The idea that COVID deaths need to match excess deaths is a bit misguided, no? The implication is that only COVID can account for the excess deaths, but that ignores the increase in drug abuse, suicide rates, and deaths from diseases for which treatments were delayed.
Full suport for the proposal of @RobertaMetsola and many others on excluding Russia from #SWIFT. Strong sanctions should indeed mean deterrent measures. The next step of Russia is already here i.e. threats against Finland and Sweden.
