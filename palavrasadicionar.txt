today
join
for
a
trip
to
the
arcade
today
at
pm
pstpm
est
tune
in
for
featuring
and
of
course
prizes
from
the
claw
machine
watch
at
this
is
so
fucked
reminder
that
beto
is
probably
the
best
bet
at
getting
this
guy
out
of
power
and
maybe
donating
to
his
campaign
is
something
you
can
do
to
help
tonight
is
the
night
for
ajax
amsterdam
to
make
a
massive
statement
to
the
european
football
world
about
their
balance
and
quality
as
a
side
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
them
walk
away
victors
tl
is
a
mess
today
i
understand
if
most
of
us
is
upset
abt
the
tour
dates
but
its
unfair
to
blame
the
boys
for
it
romelu
lukaku
believed
he
was
fit
for
lille
victory
bet
now
via
that
is
the
reason
why
majority
of
us
are
vaccinated
it
is
to
protect
others
out
there
who
like
myself
are
high
risk
of
covid
proportionate
death
rate
comparisons
from
covid
between
canada
and
the
us
are
not
even
comparable
canada
has
far
fewer
deaths
we
actually
dont
want
our
citizens
dropping
like
flies
behind
a
banner
of
socalled
freedom
well
it
looks
like
is
about
to
create
a
nd
russian
revolution
as
many
russian
citizens
oppose
the
invasion
of
the
this
war
could
topple
a
close
buddy
of
d
in
purely
practical
terms
i
think
hes
right
has
made
some
clever
moves
so
far
and
he
has
positioned
himself
well
imo
its
best
to
separate
morality
from
strategy
as
they
dont
tend
to
mix
well
on
point
all
his
secret
meetings
with
have
no
records
and
translators
were
being
told
to
leave
the
room
speaks
fluent
englishwhen
he
is
giving
out
orders
to
his
puppets
like
bonespur
its
hump
day
who
is
gonna
cum
hump
me
tell
pm
the
fact
that
is
going
into
is
due
to
aiding
to
destabilize
nato
he
just
wants
so
badly
for
a
white
dude
to
be
the
best
at
everything
lol
aint
even
top
all
time
hov
shit
himself
when
johnson
stopped
oligarchs
from
shopping
in
harrods
he
sent
bo
a
message
can
you
delay
the
rest
of
the
sanctions
a
bit
longer
give
us
time
to
get
our
cash
out
bo
duly
agreed
kev
theres
a
name
for
folk
like
you
ct
the
firings
of
multiple
inspectors
general
is
unprecedented
doing
so
without
good
cause
chills
the
independence
essential
to
their
purpose
it
is
a
threat
to
accountable
democracy
and
a
fissure
in
the
constitutional
balance
of
power
he
tweeted
didnt
all
the
land
around
russia
belong
to
the
soviet
union
at
one
time
so
why
is
taking
guns
away
from
its
citizens
in
a
time
of
war
and
invasion
why
are
they
preventing
them
from
leaving
under
the
new
martial
law
not
a
girlfriend
todd
meyer
is
a
masker
lmao
eveyone
got
covid
in
december
and

and
realized
why
in
the

were
we
masking
isolating
and
mandating
for
years
for
this
how
cana
go
ernie
order
something
that
isnt
against
the
law
to
be
prosecuted

i

a
close
estimate
of

people
with

is
based
on

rate
studies
show
a
reduction
in
long
covid
among
vaccinated
people
so
if
there
is
a
chance
or
about
in
a
reduction
places
that
at

as
a

victim
seeing
individuals
continuing

actually
stopping

if
russian

wo
permission
would
we
be
willing
to
sink
one
doubt
it
watching
this

is
so
fascinating
because
jamie
foxx
has
told
this
story
about

in

we
finally
get
to
put

these

now
do

to
spend
all
day
educating
you
on
international
relations
kanye
is
mentally
ill
and
everything
he
says
is
basically
invalidated
because
of
that
an
era
who
basically
mainstreamed
medication
suffers
mental
illnesses
from
being
raised
on
facebook
sadly
intersting
that
dictator
throwing
his
support
to
as
elden
ring
and
dark
souls
is
inimically
hostile
to
me
i
will
do
as
little
as
possible
to
actually
accommodate
it
so
no
i
will
not
be
reading
your
lore
i
will
not
piece
together
your
sad
backstory
about
jimmys
pants
i
actively
refuse
to
engage
with
your
world
the
first
official
look
of
charlie
cox
as
daredevil
has
been
released
can
stop
this
war
now
by
declaring
neutrality
they
can
stay
friendly
and
do
business
with
the
west
and
with
russia
they
dont
need
to
be
a
part
of
nato
switzerland
is
not
a
part
of

do
it
ok
sooo

the
texas
governor
has
directed
the

to
investigate
and
threaten
the
parents
of
transgender
children
based
on
false
assumptions
what
an
abuse
of
power
solution
was
easy
commit
to
a
neutral
asked
for
that
in
writing
but
noooo
eunatousa

too
political
so
instead
of
a

have
a
russian
this
from
a
coyntry
that
wants
to
take
taiwan
china
on
wednesday
accused
the
us
of
creating
fear
and
panic
over
the

reduce
rapidly
building
tensions
foreign
just
read
about
whats
happening
in
texas
its
just
fucking
evil
fuck
greg
abbott
fucking
piece
of
shit
this
is
fucking
enraging
my
texan
friends
apart
from
being
a
neonazi
govt
if
this
would
have
happened
during
s
reign
he
would
have
handed
the

aided
with
support
for
any
other
country
wanted
to
invade
what
a
nightmare
is
going
full
heinrich
himmler
on
trans
kids
and
their
parents
to
save
his
political
ass
seeing

yjr
the
west
has
made
questionable
decisions
on
these
issues
since
to
blame
whose
been
in
office
for
year
is
absurd
meanwhile
thinks
is
brilliant
for
copying
hitlers
strategy
from

you
heard
it
here
first
anybody
know
where
the
ultrauseless
un
is
in
all
of
this
id
have
thought
that
threatening
to
kick
russia
off
the
unscrupulous
if
became
the
aggressor
would
have
had
a
lot
of
impact
values
his
veto
life
without

is
a
real
struggle

miserable

this

make
a

the
dream
come

we

had
a

that
i
never

mr

i
dont
have
time

to
debate
you
with
no
disrespect
but
you
are
not
an
expert
on
russia
and
you
dont
seem
committed
to
civil
discourse
you
called
me
a
war
criminal
but
feel
free
to
debate
this
piece
what
fears
most
instead
of
doing
this
it
almost
feels
like
a
kneejerk
reaction
from
people
whod
rather
see
the
world
burn
than
accept
that
the
world
is
a
little
more
complex
than
usnato
is
an
empire
of
evil
and
it
never
does
anything
good
for

can
anyone

he
waited
for

senile
mumbling

to
become
potus
before
he
started
his

neofascist
praising
s
brutal
invasion
as
pretty
savvy
russian

looked
incredibly

xi

taiwan
sorry

sorry

thats

this
imagine
sturgeon
unilaterally
announces
she
is
joining
the
russian

and
is
off
to
allow
russian

in

what

a

have

they
will
pull

part

competition
like
conservatives

white
people
in

comprising
racists
kinksters
hedonists
cowards

should
come

stay

in

of

war
iii
and
spend
money
on

here
is
just
toying
now
with
waiting
on

countries
to

before
it
can
bring
out
the

saying
they
were
being

you

have
a

typical

just
like

fiddling

except
inept
brandon
redefines

daily
and
xi
are
delighted
with
our
feckless
president
we
in
britain
love
their
comments
were
less
than
years
before
invaded
crimea
and
shot
down
a
commercial
aircraft
a
short
walk
from
my
house
this
afternoon
west
endoutside
the
russian
consulate
people
peacefully
protesting
about
russias
massive
military
attack
on
washington
ap
in
the
opening
hours
of

assault
on
how
about
just
ending
the
mask
charade
altogether
if
mitch
mcconnell
meanwhile
in
cycling
that
paragon
of
high
moral
values
a
rider
from
a
team
sponsored
by
the
russian
state
aka
wins
in
a
race
held
in
a
country
with
a
very
dubious
human
rights
record
great
stuff
your
taking
every
opportunity
to
place
yourself
in
the
spotlight
as
some
kind
of
guardian
of
but
in
the
end
my
point
is
that
separatists
inviting
them
in
is
total
bs
is
a
mobster
expanding
his
territory
because
he
wants
what
they
have
its
a
terrible
day
for
western
it
was
always
the
goal
of
the
us
to
marginalize
impact
on
world
dealings
even
if
it
did
invade
its
former
soviet
territories
the
impact
would
be
minimal
judging
from
equity
markets
and
s
response
of
nothing
i
would
say
this
strategy
is
a
success
why
would
anyone
imagine
for
an
instant
that
the
uk
or
the
nato
allies
are
entitled
to
any
loyalty
from
india
what
have
any
of
us
done
for
them
lately
centuries
of
colonialism
erased
from
memory
just
like
that
get
real
the
gate
of
khyber
used
to
be
opened
and
closed
by
strong
men
imam
ali
as
alone
lifted
and
broke
the
gate
in
one
strong
jolt
he
then
used
the
same
gate
to
make
a
bridge
on
a
trench
so
that
islamic
forces
could
enter
the
fort
and
capture
it
he
used
to
stream
the
buzzer
but
i
guess
he
cant
any
longer
due
to
huge
pirate
activity
incllots
of

anywhere
in

that
is
one
issue
but
the
maps
of

minirals
the
reality
is

looks
weak
to
the
world
the
usa
looks
weak
to
the

i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
one
day
we
wakeup
to
a
civil
war
with
such
divided
nation
and
who
ever
think
makes
any

its
a
moron
the
same
people
who
have
been
squawking
for
the

two

at
everyone
around

wear

you
have
not
provided

more
empty

full

there
are
misdeeds
that

you
know
it

a

first

was
a
failure
i
dont
know
what
to
say
an
absolutly
pathetic
political
performance
ukranians
will
do
better
aginst
russia
that
the
dpotus
will
do

the

is
nominated
to
serve

currently

she
is

brightest

will
be

the

just
because
offoreign
conflicts
its
important
for
him
to
announce
who
the
next
scotus

will
be
on

so
now
republicans
can
find
every
reason
to
be
against

cant
allow

in
we
must
stand

before

cant
help
but
think
of
the
young
russian
men
some
of
them
yo
fighting
a
war
they
dont
support
for
a
leader
who
will
sacrifice
them
any
moment
dont
think
snapped
he
saw

fragility
and
his
baggage
as
a
once
in
a

opportunity
to

perceived

doesnt
help
that
many
of

humble
request
for
you
old
boris
really
understood
the
situation
the
days
of
european
tank
battles
are
over
really
it
takes
a
special
kind
of
bravery
to
protest
in

russia
detained
for
peaceful
protesting
across
russian

the

justintime
were
now
playing
catchup
in
cyber
amazing
vladimir
actually
threatened
the
united
states
and
its
allies
with
nuclear
strikes
you
kiddingall
russian
banks
and
energy
companies
under
sanctionsnon
of
them
can
use
their
money
to
invest
in
any
pipelineand
pakistan
has
no
money
and
can
not
be
trusted
after
what
happened
to
iranian
pipeline
completed
to
pakistani
border
can
you
imagine
selling
your
citizens
safety
and
children
yeah
go
there
due
to
the
unpopular
opinion
of
the
ukrainian
political
figures
the
administration
became
desperate
for
american
assistance
it
was
the
refusal
to
let
go
of
power
that
lead
to
the
corrupt
conclusion
watch
how
the
gop
treats
s
leftist
scotus
nominee
theyll
be
scared
to
criticize
her
because
theyll
be
called
racist
in
opposing
the
st
black
woman
the
ds
are
never
cordial
with
gop
supreme
court
picks
super
weird
in
days
since
the
invasion
youve
not
had
scathing
word
to
say
about
only
how
theyve
modernised
their
military
and
how
the
tories
are
funded
by
them
its
pretty
telling
really
wouldnt
you
say
dom
it
has
a
lot
of
friends
russia
yes
of
course
it
is
bad
that
civilians
are
being
attacked
but
the
ukrainian
government
is
to
blame
for
the
fact
that
it
got
this
bad
in
the
first
place
if
the
government
had
simply
remained
neutral
and
if
nato
had
simply
kept
its
promise
come
on
i
just
read
a
us
leftist
atheist
anticapitalist
etc
tweet
about
etcetc
so
many
people
die
bc
of
us
healthcare
etc
when
will
we
fight
that
war
if
he
wants
to
talk
about
that
fine
but
dont
do
it
related
to
is
as
much
of
a
hero
as
is
a
real
hero
would
not
have
let
this
war
happen
in
the
first
place
i
can
only
hope
now
that
he
acts
quickly
to
reach
a
ceasefire
agreement
with
before
more
innocents
die
this
isnt
some
virtue
signaling
shit
avoid
bloodshed
and
needless
casualties
otherwise
you
will
be
bombed
a
soldier
responds
russian
warship
go
f
yourself
those
were
the
final
known
words
heard
from
the
island
all
ukrainian
defenders
were
killed
in
a
russian
bombardment
gov
desantis
kept
his
silence
on
during
his
cpac
speech
its
shameful
and
unamerican
if
cant
stand
up
for
democracy
in
how
can
he
look
floridians
in
the
eye
and
promise
to
fight
for
democracy
in
cuba
venezuela
china
and
elsewhere
i
just
read
a
youtube
comment
that
said
russia
has
had
a
long
history
over
just
control
and
only
fighting
of
resistors
not
unarmed
civilians
as
someone
whos
second
fav
pastime
is
russian
history
great
as
the
russian
army
moves
on
an
independent
european
capital

first
time
since

when
russia
had
the
audacity
to
send
a
song
about
peace
to
eurovision
in
and
europe
voted
that
sht

one
year
after
the
illegal

why
is

more
chilling
than

pray
up
they
are
going
down
which
deadly
autocracy
are
you
talking
about
exactly
saudi
arabia
china
because
your
country
is
doing
business
with
them
too
russia
is
practically
a
neighbour
why
dont
you
live
in
finnland
poland
or
germany
and
then
talk
big
about
taking
a
stand
against
them
still
waiting
on
ilya

to
put
forward
his
totally
objective
standard
under
which
ketanji

is
objectively
lesser
than

i
had
no
idea
what
a
molotov
cocktail
was
until
yesterday
i
thought
it
could
be
a
delicious
cocktail
made
with
russian
vodka
might
cause
indigestion
you
are
fuckin
idiots
is
well
no
one
laughed
at

respected
and
feared
which
party
ridiculed
when
he
followed
through
on
a

commitment
to
nominate
a
black
american
to
a
seat
on
the
supreme
court
welcoming

nope
radical
left

so
i
wont

in

im
likely
to
go
from
mary
mother
of
jesus
to
mc
hammer
the
real
one
really
quick
ion
wanna
be
yelled
at
in

so
yall
have
at
it
lmao
why
he
is
studying
in
is
more
important
than
his
life
who
did
this
to
us
like
if
you
have
the
opportunity
to
study
outside
you
wont
because
you
cant
envy
has
clouded
your
reasoning
seek
help
and
fast
you
need
it
im
half
ukrainian
and
i
have
to
ask
you
created
an
account
just
this
month
to
spew
your
lies
and
propaganda
youre
merely
a
lemming
longed
thought
the
worlds
stock
markets
r
but
veritable
casinos
down
yesterday
up
by
the
same
day
as
irrational
as
save
for
the
fact
there
has
been
a
tsunami
of
short
selling
yesterday
n
the
same
scale
of
buy
back
day
indeed
probably
lead
the
way
wikipedia
would
have
told
you
that
the
rus
empire
started
with
the
an
rus
russia
belongs
to
here
is
explaining
it
then
lets
look
back
at
what
shokin
was
investigating
and
i
think
about
people
in
donetsklugansk
that
have
been
under
missiles
for
years
and
that
nato
provided
even
more
arms
to
like
permission
to
keep
shelling
they
basically
gave
a
gun
to
kill
it
amazes
me
that
no
one
is
talking
about
it
the
last
hours
in
on
the
as
of
february
in
initial
stage
all
eu
leader
confirmed
all
kind
of
support
to
but
today
all
are
back
down
just
even
today
talked
with
leaders
of
nato
to
join
but
none
of
them
gave
positive
reply
leave
on
its
own
look
at
rain
in
this
tweet
its
from
one
of
those
guys
has
rain
in
it
plays
a
part
also
if
you
know
the
code
has
in
it
so
does
lviv
just
adds
the
this
is
attached
to
fbi
jackson
so
im
hoping
people
know
cant
say
im
biggest
fan
gee
i
wonder
what
is
so
special
about
these
people
that
europe
is
willing
to
welcome
them
with
open
arms
nope
yup
hamilton
didnt
receive
or
give
money
to
thats
the
difference
hand
painted
wish
government
on
all
levels
had
paid
as
much
attention
to
the
war
in
their
own
country
as
they
are
to
the
ruasian
one
are
we
using
the
seized
freedom
convoy
funds
to
aid
the
conflict
russian
military
forces
have
reached
the
capital
and
gunfire
and
heavy
rocket
strikes
has
been
heard
near
to
the
government
district
you
ever
sit
here
if
youre
in
your
s
or
older
and
think
of
the
amount
of
life
changing
moments
weve
gone
through
covid
market
crashes
housing
market
crashes
hurricanes
this
shit
in
we
picked
a
hell
of
a
time
to
be
alive
it
never
gets
better
i
agree
said
this
am
this
is
beyond
crazyin
stead
of
using
chechen
demographics
to
stabilise
the
russian
consumer
basethe
chechens
are
forced
to
fight
and
die
on
other
nations
soil
also
add
to
this
list
who
has
now
magically
pivoted
to
being
an
expert
in
both
she
also
still
has
her
ridiculous
pinned
psa
about
never
taking
your
mask
off
indoors
lest
you
immediately
catch
covid
and
die
you
talking
about
human
beings
you
are
saying
dont
use
sanctions
use
peoplewhy
arent
the
other
nato
countries
sending
people
all
of
a
sudden
people
like
are
talking
about
the
swift
network
as
if
they
understand
the
issues
a
risk
of
suspending
russia
from
swift
is
that
they
will
strengthen
their
own
internal
systems
and
create
alternatives
with
china
understand
words
before
you
say
them
vladimir
has
been
planning
this
war
for
years
thats
why
got
donald
to
pull
america
out
of
the
open
skies
policy
when
he
had
that
private
meeting
with
what
else
did
ask
to
do
devide
america
and
undermine
nato
among
other
things
this
project
is
really
good
very
enthusiastic
team
great
community
i
hope
the
project
thrives
i
love
your
project
the
turkish
foreign
minister
has
said
turkey
cannot
stop
russian
warships
accessing
the
black
sea
via
its
straits
as
has
requested
due
to
a
clause
in
an
international
pact
a
real
hero
trying
to
protect
their
country
deep
respect
i
pray
for
your
salvation
and
for
all
the
ukrainian
people
governor
evers
you
say
you
are
praying
for
the
children
in
that
is
great
ya
you
try
to
talk
about
this
and
people
act
like
that
automatically
means
youre
a
russian
state
agent
father
saying
goodbye
to
his
daughter
as
he
puts
her
on
a
bus
to
safety
and
he
stays
behind
to
fight
for
its
a
democrat
thing
channeling
his
inner
obama
as
always
last
time
out
modi
govt
foreign
policy
everything
is
internal
matter
and
then
complain
that
nobody
came
to
help
us
when
china
was
busy
occupying
indian
territories

hopefully
in
the
future
it
can
be
even
more
successful
for
the
team
i
like
that
approach
however
in
by
pulling
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
imposing
heavy
sanctions
on
said
country
along
with
his
tariffs
made
the
price
of
oil
barrels
skyrocket
which
helped
solidify
his
power
and
strenghten
his

really
have
to
appreciate
producer
sk
for
taking
this
much
effort
love
u
na
huge
kudos
to
bro
in

its
time
to
boycott
any
companies
that
support
russian
republican
propaganda
shows
like
fox
and
boycott
american
companies
that
support
it
exactly
some
of
you
people
are
mocking
our
brothers
and
sisters
in
haaa
what
ghetto
jealousy
is
this
allow
the
ones
who
want
to
help
them
abeg
in
s
mind
he
probably
thinks
russia
can
how
the
hell
india
is
in
difficult
position
russia
is
time
tested
old
friend
india
dont
backstab
friends
like
usa
and
nato
did
to
give
india
veto
power
we
will
try
to
persuade
russia
the
government
is
the
antichrist
with
the
jesus
interfaced
and
mohammed
opposing
religion
is
powerful
and
trust
me
russsia
and
what
do
you
think
is
the
link
between
socialism
which
is
heavily
prosocial
and
the
violent
invasion
of
a
sovereign
nation
or
did
you
not
study
history
at
all
russia
attacked
the
centre
of
world
human
trafficking
which
is
based
in
the
and
harris
sons
are
both
in
the
doing
and
planning
bad
things
for
the
world
a
centre
for
nazism
is
also
in
suddenly
remembered
that
cravity
was
supposed
to
release
a
new
album
last
tuesday
but
it
was
postponed
bc
of
covid
i
was
so
excited
to
hear
their
new
songs
it
is
not
sovereign
it
didnt
apply
for
its
borders
the
only
thing
i
worry
about
is
using
chernobyl
as
a
bargaining
chip
when
he
kept
mentioning
nuclear
ideally
we
are
deploying
elements
of
the
response
force
on
land
at
sea
and
in
the
air
to
further
strengthen
our
posture
and
to
respond
quickly
to
any
contingency
says
sec
gen
stoltenberg
this
is
the
first
time
the
force
has
been
used
for
collective
security
if
you
are
polish
like
me
and
any
update
on
partygate
and
publication
of
the
unredacted
russian
report
disappear
just
like
that
is
an

russia

go

fucking
trying

all
this
where
were
all
these
humanitarians
when
the
were
being

and
bombed
in

not
a
peep
about
it
in

made
a
huge
mistake
not

in
dis
a
real
good
take
nato
has
taken
the
existence
of
european
alliances
as
a
given
and
it
is
absolutely
not
the
world
granted
by
bretton
woods
is
a
wild
aberration
and
not
nearly
the
norm
its
clear
that
wants
to
take
the
capital
city
and
impose
its
own
government
at
war
nah
i
was
exaggerating
but
it
would
be
smart
for
ukrainian
forces
to
take
advantage
of
the
antiwar
protests
in
russia
these
guys
dont
even
look

soldiers
hello
sorry
for
being
so
inactive
but
im
not
gonna
post
any
photos
for
a
little
lapse
of
time
and
focus
on
spreading
info
about
whats
happening
in
the
world
right
now
sending
all
my
prayers
to
they
wont
the
plan
is
to
gobble
op
more
and
more
russian
land
ask
napoleon
and
anyone
after
him
its
why
makes
such
a
big
play
what
does
really
want
since
we
have
no
to
go
ask
that
question
and
i
keep
hearing
this
question
a
lot
heres
what
i
really
think
wants
he
wants
to
be
stopped
thats
why
he
challenges
everyone
and
everything
you
can
say
this
until
youre
blue
in
the
face
i
dont
have
time
to
just
sit
there
on
i
have
things
i
have
to
get
done
my
heart
is
heavy
just
go
home
dude
you
clearly
have
issues
to
take
care
of
its
arrogance
flowers
on
its
success
in
using
an
abstraction
can
we
provide
a

ride
for
josh
hawley
cruz
ron
johnson
and
house
republicans
to
they
could
fight
for
their
leader
even
though
it
can
be
very
arguable
about
what
the
us
have
done
but
damn
near
no
one
agrees
with
russia
invading
why
does
want
to
make
rich
by
buying
so
much
russia
oil
i
thought
was
s
butt
boy
you
do
know
when
america
buys
russian
oil
it
is
killing
ukrainians
where
were
these
rights
when
minorities
living
in
were
threatened
and
their
fundamental
rights
trampled
on
the
ukrainian
government
is
nothing
more
than
a
business
partner
of
the
us
presidents
family
what
kind
of
ukrainian
parliament
is
it
where
often
speak
english
i
am
proud
of
nomination
today
of
judge
ketanji
brown
to
become
the
th
justice
of
the
supreme
court
judge
brown
already
has
a
distinguished
career
as
a
jurist
and
will
make
a
remarkable
addition

no
sir
if
you
dont
want
to
do
this
and
think
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
european
broadcasting
union
has
announced
that
russia
will
not
take
part
in
this
years
euro
isoniazid
song
contest
in
response
to
the
russian
invasion
of
thats
gonna
stop
for
sure
i
did
not
think
s
earlier
diplomatic
assertions
made
sense
obviously
besides
the
ukrainian
citizens
i
feel
really
bad
for
him
the
stress
and
weight
of
the
responsibility
he
must
feel
must
be
fucking
intense
this
person
calls
themselves
a
left
libertarian
not
only
do
they
support
nato
expansion
they
retweet
matthew
dowd
and
claim
that
azov
only
consists
of
about
members
sadly
i
dont
think
hell
make
first
team
guard
or
forward
i
really
do
feel
bad
because
a
few
yrs
ago
i
was
doing
research
on
their
bad
blood
and
its
sad
that
this
many
years
later
its
still
going
i
dont
have
ukrainian
friends
but
seeing
people
struggleit
hurts
bad
its
just
not
fair
yknow
is
exposing
a
fundamental
weakness
of
this
is
not
going
to
be
wwiii
but
keep
an
eye
on
chinataiwan
anyone
who
is
still
taking
the
nato
serious
turkey
has
got
the
nd
largest
army
of
the
nato
but
they
dont
give
a
shit
about
the
nato
to
help
its
not
the
plan
of
the
system
to
let
the
nato
help
rules
out
intervention
in
well
didnt
we
all
know
that
hope
this
comes
to
end
quickly
go
fuck
yourself
you
absolute
balloon
we
have
trained
more
than
k
ukrainians
provided
them
with
lethal
capabilities
which
they
are
using
right
now
a
royal
navy
destroyer
hms
diamond
has
set
sail
to
be
on
standby
we
have
provided
funds
weapons
push
for
non
use
of
swift
sanctions
not
any
rational
person
desires
wwiii
ignores
agreements
leaders
are
facing
down
the
red
army
in
kyev
and
our
government
is
afraid
of
a
long
and
lengthy
court
case
afraid
of
upsetting
their
paymasters
s
troops
are
terrorist
is
a
terrorist
just
like
osama
bin
laden
the
industrys
reaction
to
the
russian
invasion
of
was
swift
but
not
unexpected
so
far

a
proof
that

its
a
stupid
choice
russia

what
you
are
saying
is
reasonable
and
reasonable
people
have
tried
it
for

anything
else
dont
let
the
adults
handle
the

in
have
a
seat
with
the
man
child
ban
russian
oil
exports
the
reason
why
the
us
and
uk
are
a
little
dormant
is
that
they
are
just
waiting
for
russia
to
just
blow
air
on
nato
allier
so
the
they
take
over
the
war
is
not
yet
a
member
of
nato
thats
why
responses
are
delaying
hold
still
there
are
three
possible
legal
outcomes
following
suspension
suspended
state
putting
an
end
to
the
serious
violation
of
the

withdrawal
of
the

termination
of

coordinated

to
address
the
public
serbian
church
calls
for
cessation
of
the

in

describes
it
as
a
painful
tragedy
of

while
its

and
liverpool

then
chelsea
and

for

still
plenty
what
yall
dont
know
is
that
this
war
is
no
ones
fault
other
than
pristiano

he
is

cancel
the

cup
since
he
is
not

shame
on
you
pendu
we
germans
hate
that
our
government
was
so
stupid
as
to
allow
us
to
become
so
dependent
on
russia
that
cutting
our
ties
with
them
means
risking
a
major
blow
to
our
economy
and
a
serious
disruption
to
our
energy
supplies
s
got
us
by

theres
some
heartbreaking
accounts

im

thread
most
of
my

are
western
tech
geeks
who
live
in

countries
when
the
united

invaded
iraq
the
sanctions
are
effectively
permanent
the
west
never
lifts
sanctions
not
on
iran
north
korea
yemen
or
russia
it
will
also
never
lift
the
tech
sanctions
against
china
so
you
are
right
those
countries
now
understand
that
cooperating
with
the
west
is
a
waste
of
time
so
is
it
ok
to
invade
florida
to
get
rid
of
the
real
nazis
in
that
government

dont
really
know
the
extent
to
which

policies
or
treatments
or
if
theyre
making
new
interventions
and
what
those
interventions
are
russia

detained
more
than
a
thousand
of

far
they

anyone
that
values
freedom
over
corrupt
incompetent
sociopath
totalitarian
politicians

in
the
us
do
americans
have
any
influence
over
russian
foreign
policy
isnt
russia
a
dictatorship
its
not
in
their
view
favorite
part
of
heaping
praise
on
here
is
how
percent
wrong
he
is
claiming
to
go
in
as
peacekeepers
for
donetsk
and
luhansk
was
a
terrible
idea
it
fooled
no
one
no
one
played
along
and
bailed
pretending
immediately
hes
just
relentlessly
dumb
this
guy
am
not
happy

when

give
the
money
back
and
stand
up
like
a

make

afaik
germany
still

said
i
think
if
youre
lithuanian
it
makes
sense
not
to
want
to
decrease
your
ethnic
homogeneity
too
much
but
for
western
europe
ukrainians
would
increase
their
overrall
european
population
by
counterbalancing
the
noneuropeans
already
settled
there
when
you
know
what
socialism
is
and
are
not

shouldnt
be

very
well
doing

sad
to

going
through

i
hope
they

through
this
atrocity
i
watched

and
the

personally

love

i
have
a
feeling

put

bullet
in
his

in
a

sometime
soon
just
like
hitler
did
oh
im
russian
by
the
way
and
the
republicans
arent
even
hiding
their
loyalty
to
anymore
where
were
they
four
years
ago
when
hillary
was
right
about
being
s
puppet
now
they
say
s
not
doing
enough
at
the
same
time
those
people
simultaneously
confuse
me
and
piss
me
off
russian
tank
maliciously
crushes
civilian
car
with

inside
via

reminded
me
of
reading
about
the
ending
of
ww
when
german
soldiers
begged
americans
to
take
them
prisoners
as
russian
forces
were
advancing
watching
this
is
very
intense
and
a
reminder
of
the
very
real
effect
this
has
on
people
i
hope
he
makes
it
out
in
time
no
be
lie
be
that
ghana
ambassador
said
they
cant
even
afford
to
evacuate
over
the
murderous
regime
cares
nothing
for
human
life
and
is
much
keener
on
making
an
example
of
as
a
warning
to
all
that
might
stand
in
their
way
demonically
inspired
marco
what
demon
called
vladimir
a
genius
peacemaker
thereby
encouraging
him
to
invade
and
what
did
you
do
to
stand
with
president
against
the
demon
and
vladimir
voters
will
remember
what
you
didnt
do
wont
we
the
us
should
evacuate
then
host
the
government
in
exile
on
an
american
or
allied
warship
inside
nato
territorial
waters
and
assist
in
secure
communications
to
the
people
of
when
this
over
world
leaders
will
shake
hands
and
say
sorry
but
sorry
wont
remove
the
blood
stain
from
the
earth
they
stand
upon
many
children
will
be
raised
without

because
of
your
lack

heartless

we

they

used

which
the

didnt
last
a

so
maybe
the
expectation
of

is
accurate

money
possible
motive
but
cant
let
in
due
too
easy
to
turn
missiles
against
central
pwr
definitely
he
is
truly
evil
though
as
another
person
said
on
here
perhaps
cummings
in
a
similar
position
as
would
be
equally
as
bad
its
possible
that
his
charges
were
fabricated
to
give
him
plausible
reason
to
be
in
the
uk
and
make
him
seem
like
hes
not
an
ally
of
the
russian
government
im
not
saying
he
isnt
but
i
urge
caution
im
already
sick
of
the
war
being
used
for
factional
politicking
us
give
weapon
for
delivering
to
its
enemies
indirectlyeg
delivered
to
via
afghan
national
army
and
now
russia
via
ukrainian
army
instead
they
can
handover
it
directly
without
any
conflict
while
there
are
armed
neonazi
militias
in
and
everywhere
they
are
not
politically
powerful
ukrainian
jews
were
definitely
not
seeking
russian
liberation
from
them
is
jewish
fyi
now
would
be
a
good
time
for
an
aspiring
journo
to
ask
her
why
she
thought
selling
uranium
to
in
exchange
for
donations
to
the
was
a
good
idea
the
picture
of
war
painted
by
those
who
know
exactly
why
wants
to
boot
out
illegal
ukrainian
gov
youve
completely
lost
your
minds
history
will
remember
the
final
downfall
of
russia
as
a
world
power
the
united
states
aids
and
her
people
so
that
they
can
fight
russia
over
there
and
we
dont
have
to
fight
russia
here
the
us
has
gotten
what
it
asked
for
when
it
decided
in
to
use
to
fight
russia
over
there
we
have
highprecision
spy
systems
in
the
russian
systems
that
work
invisibly
and
of
the
who
support
ukrainians
and
their
families
are
fearing
for
their
lives
as
russia
invades
their
country
many
have
been
forced
to
flee
their
homes
you
have
been
sharing
our
intelligence
on
russia
with
china
begging
it
to
stop
russia
china
in
turn
shared
that
with
russia
and
sided
with
you

internal
conflicts
about

he
gave
everyone
a
blueprint

also
only

built
at
the
time
it
was
canceled
but
you
are
making
a
very
good
argument
for
decreasing
oil

only
now
is
she

about
she
forgets
the
point
that
the

we
are
willing
to
make
that
sacrifice
act
now

man
who
did
not

ahem

to

eu
plans

if
this
awful
uncalled
for
tragedy
has
taught
me
one
thing
its
that
ukrainians
are
way
more
fucking
hard
and
badass
than
us
just
following
up
by
collecting
magma
from
hope
everyone
is
as
safe
as
they
can
be
right
now
after

in

change
demography
of

artifi
cially
gentlemen
this
man
and
buiden
is
the
most
useless
people
on

will
any

the
progressives
in
congress
dare
to
mention
nato
expansion
and
how
the
us
has
used
in
a
game
of
nuclear
chicken
it
took
americans
like
weeks
to
get
over
the
afghanistan
withdrawal
so
i
cant
wait
for
them
to
also
get
over
pretending
to
care
about

simultaneously
ignoring
the

my
question
is
will
the
russian
military
take
account
that
is
arming
its
citizens
and
providing
ammo
wouldnt
this
be
some
form
of
deterrent
to
consider
you
know
very
well

appear
poised

advantage
of
the
international
communitys
aver
this
is
a
russian
military
ship

suggest

avoid
bloodshed
and
unnecessary
victims
otherwise
we
will
open
fire
on
you
america
needs
leaders
now
not
lawless
tyrants
and
theives
that
ignored
the
fact
that
democrats
with
china
and
their
proxies
helped
deny
americans

rights
before
the

why
has

just
isnt
totally
crazy

is
quite
an
eye
opening
experience
for
me
i
know
a
lot
of
indonesians
dislike
the
us
this
is
the
time
to

before
he
gets
any

ill
be
live
on
my
channel
at
pm
est
for
the
event
start
then
continuing
my
first
playthrough
after
the
ukrainian
nazi
military
has
been
shelling
the
civilian
population
of
donbass
with
grad
missile
launchers
since
wednesday
and
burning
their
homes
today
thousands
of
children
have
been
evacuated
from
donbass
to
the
refugee
camps
in
russia
of
which
no
one
speaks
that
footage
of
a
russian
tank
running
over
a
civilians
car
then
ukranian
people
trying
to
help
the
old
man
get
out
of
it
is
fucking
horrifying
beijing
is
not
a
meme
coach
tite
said
friday
he
would
step
down
after
the
in
qatar
for
which
his
fivetime
world
champions
are
among
the
favorites
fair
enough
as
long
as
us
stay
the
fvck
out
of
this
and
sanctions
if
any
only
target
regime
and
do
no
harm
to
any
civilian
implying
that
nato
is
merely
a
vehicle
to
boost
the
military
industrial
complexs
bottom
line
is
absurd
sure
that
is
wrong
i
wholeheartedly
agree
but
since
isnt
a
nato
member
theyre
not
obliged
to
help
in
anyway
problem
is
that
if
any
nato
member
intervenes
not
a
single
country
remains
safe
wwlll
will
be
inevitable
the
same
poll
reveals
black
womens
top
reasons
why
its
important
to
support
a
black
woman
nominee
diversity
many
scotus
rulings
affect
black
women
has
gone
too
long
without
a
single
black
woman
justice
honor
black
womens
historic
role
in
democracy
fight
joined
on
by
in
moscow
in
berlin
and
in
london
for
latest
on
guess
this
is
another
issue
we
will
never
agree
upon
i
mean
as
the
attack
was
happening
was
praising
plan
on
live
tv
he
thought
american
marines
were
making
an
amphibious
landing
i
get
is
not
all
there
but
to
pretend
is
well
thats
insane
this
is
the
dumbest
take
possible
it
is
because
of
s
failed
leadership
that
is
invading
under
no
new
wars
for
the
first
time
in
decades
if
was
the
aspirations
would
have
been
imperialist
take
overs
of
foreign
nations
this
is
an
epic
fail
ok
so
i
heard
directly
from
a
medical
professional
that
being
vaxxed
and
boosted
means
less
potential
initial
viral
load
those
were
border
guards
not
intended
equipped
or
expected
to
fight
the
invading
enemys
navy
nobody
would
have
blamed
them
for
surrendering
which
makes
them
heroes
even
more
so
i
cant
believe
they
said
this
shit
with
their
whole
chest
like
do
they
not
ofc
they
dont
understand
the
implications
of
no
gas
for
european
countries
not
only
is
russia
invading
the
theyre
making
a
resource
war
with
eastern
europe
that
will
have
mass
implications
it
was
said
about
that
if
you
had
a
nicer
house
than
his
house
keith
you
can
fool
yourself
but
i
am
a
retired

the

it

to
creep

up

but
now
nato
us
empire
may
actually
be
starting

yes
but
you
conveniently
avoid
the
fact
that
we
our
commander

has
significant
responsibility
in

bernie
not
completely
unlike

very

as

unfold
overseas

if

but
also
with

then
its
the
least
that
you
can
do
for
ukrainian
family
krеmlin
has
the
gall
to
call
the
ukrainian
government
illegitimate
and
fascist
when
the
only
reason
рutіn

are
still
not

is
antidemocratic

arrests
and
legal
action
against

that
it

depends

many
innocent

are
dying
due
to
the

dear
a
humble
request
for
you
the
intel
was
right
the
failure
was
on
s
refusal
to
admit
wasnt
joining
nato
yes
russia
has
blundered
its
way
into
stupid
murderous
war
but
giving
them
something
at
the
negotiating
table
might
prevented
it
and
it
wouldnt
have
done
any
harm
poland
ammo
supply
from
polish
army
went
to
poland
has
joined
sweden
and
finland
should
respond
by
assisting
in
beating
back
russia
then
all
join
nato
continue
the
sanctions
until
and
his
oligarchs
are
no
longer
in
power
in
russia
blackburns
decision
to
swan
around
cpac
after
an
unprovoked
fullscale
invasion
cheered
on
by
her
idol
unhinged
propagandist
is
extremely
inappropriate
once
again
blackburn
is
putting
the
demands
of
the
radical
right
ahead
of
whats
best
for
our
nation
nato
will
defend
any
member
territory
like
its
own
thats
the
deal
uk
is
not
in
nato
its
not
about
oil
or
whats
in
the
ground
plus
its
a
tough
call
military
action
means
wwiii
which
could
easily
mean
the
end
of
everything
you
ready
for
that
im
staying
off
twitter
the
amount
of
fake
news
about
the
ukrainian
war
put
throat
goat
in
a
room
with
okay
but
let
me
paint
a
picture
had
we
along
with
our
nato
allys
maybe
we
could
have
stopped
the
first
tanker
who
dared
to
cross

cant
imagine
following

saying
golly
i
gotta
get
me
some
of
that
in
any
event
russian
troops
have
chernobyl
surrounded
its
a
tremendous
pressure
for
anyone
let
alone
someone
in

autumn
years
i
feel
there
should
be
an
age

already
proposed
the
exact

its

late
now
theres
too
much
at
stake
for

this
phase
of

and
he
wont
stop
his
militaristic
reckless
adventurism
until
someone

all

told

all
exactly
what
would
do
for
months
before

and
he
has
done
everything
we
said
he
would
you
all
said
we
were
a
conspiracy
but
now
we
were
completely
percent
right
you
all
are
so
ignorant
patriots
in
facing
certain
death
defending
their
country
as
they
fight
against

invaders
patriots
in

states
verbally
berating
an

at

because
they
were
politely
asked

wear

narrowmindedness
of

even
worse

i
cant
even
oh
my

the
irony
of

china

in

russias

assets
in

been
frozen
as
well
as

this

is

available

we
have
activated

by
drawing
on

forces
us
troops
were
put
on

weeks

to
potentially
bolster
a

force
we
owe

to
after

treasonous

lifted
up
i
remember
when
the
gop
suggested
firing

as
a

of

for

is
a
war
criminal
if
we
would
just
declared
that
would
not
be
admitted
to

then
either

at

a
matter
of

to
see
what

and
they
betrayed
and
the
gs
sanctions
are
unless

russia
must
be
expelled
from

of

so
that
it
does
not
use

right
when
it

condemned
in

to
be
deprived
of
this
right
as
a

even
tho
in

obligation
to

sacrificing

forcefully
isnt
the
right

maybe
he
should
surrender
asap
and
military
requires
you
have

so
theyd
have

however
lesson
for
syrians
once
we
remove
the
regime
we
need
to
aim
to
obtain
nuclear
weapons
this
is
the
only
way
it

the

barrett
barrett
has
never

or
argued
an
appeal
in
any
court
nor
has
she
ever
performed
any
notable
pro

work
even
during
law
school
so
wants
to
join
nato
to
protect
them
from
a
russia
invasion
now
they
are
not
in
nato
and
they
got
invaded
its
all
the
west
fault
for
egging
on
for
americans
playing
basketball
in
escaping
has
not
been
easy
said
one

nobody
thought
anything

this

i
dont

where
we
went
off

why
didnt
they
post
the
minsk

signed

by

in
oh

lonzo
different

different

different

same
occasion
azerbaijan
baku
kiev
from
my
very
basic
understanding
they
applied
to
join
nato
once
in
but
was
delayed
and
then
again
in
after
the
war
and
it
is
seen
as
an
act
of
aggression
against
russia
who
doesnt
want
any
of
their
bordering
countries
to
be
part
of
nato
in
nato
put
them
on
why
is
he
endangering
his
people
let
him
vacate
and
go
and
let
people
form
a
new
government
why
is
the
stooge
clinging
on
to
power
without
any
external
help
that
man
is
on
your
side
try
calling
somebody
who
can
talk

russia
is
planning
a
largescale
provocation
aimed
at
dehumanizing
ukrainiansaccusing
of
allegedly
inhumane
acts
dont
be
fooled
is
defending
its
land
in
a
just
defensive
war
unlike
russia
we
do
not
aim
at
kindergartens
and
civilians
imagine
if
told
y
that
he
would
like
to
help
him
in
the
war
with
russia
but
only
if
he
announces
that
hes
investigating
donald
first
helped
animals
from
ukriane
feels
amazing
unless
youre
literally
going
to
and
fighting
you
arent
doing
anything
worrying
about
the
war
isnt
an
excuse
not
to
do
your
job
neither
does
you
talking
shit
if
is
granted
permission
to
join
russia
should
also
be
granted
access
too
because
if
not
this
will
most
certainly
lead
to
nuclear
war
and
russia
will
have
its
hands
tied
with
no
other
option
to
fully
defend
retaliate
back
and
your
point
is
i
believe
you
are
one
off
by
one
but
i
stand
corrected
see
ref
below
its
six
now
that
barrett
is
confirmed
i
truly
do
not
believe
they
push
their
religious
precepts
and
catechism
upon
society
just
bcos
president
has
decided
to
send
a
small
penance
to
for
flirting
with
america
i
dont
think
he
can
actually
make
that
happen
without
destroying
russia
i
feel
like
hes
going
to
have
to
find
some
way
to
back
down
at
some
point
he
is
pointing
out
what
a
paper
tiger

really
is

makes
sense
my
only
concern
is
that
russia
would
never
accept
a
permanent
neutral
s
ultimate
egocentric
goal
has
always
been
to
reestablish
the
ussr
he
wouldve
pulled
this
at
some
point
the
presidency
was
his
opening

i
appreciate
the

he
shouldnt
have
announced
it
in
advance
tho
where
would
we
be
if
we
announced
that
we
were
going
to
stage
a
protest
involving
rosa

man
some
stuff
needs
to
stay

lol
not
if
you
bitch
drops

because
he
spat
his
dummy
out
he
has
started
a

he
cannot
win
and
will
take
the

with
him
he
is
no

he
is
a

very
important
message
to
all
ukrainians
join

against

these
days
you
are
making

that

inflation
happens
but
typically
a

should
mitigate
it

his
policies
not
make
it
exponentially
worse
can
you
point
to
what
is
doing
to
lower
inflation
or
gas
prices
my
point
is
we
have
an
extremist
and
illegitimate
scotus
right
now
and
a
nation
of
rabid
gun
nuts
who
will
accept
no
limits
whatsoever
so
any
reasonable
compromise
at
all
is
not
gonna
happen
sadly
so
apparently
elden

some

currently
not

china
we
all
know
no
one
will
come
to
fight
your

wont
stand
against
russia
if

wont

are
defending
themselves
with
the
weapons
supplied
by

hope
you
are
getting
my
point
we
have
to
anyway
mirv
warheads
need
to
be
tested
before
we
put
them
on
a
missile
china
will
also
think
twice
before
starting
a
war
with
us
he
waited
until
weak
dopey
joe
became
president
to
make
his
move
on
even
though
is
a
genius
hes
also
a
threat
to
the
world
like
hitler
what
happen
to
joe
campaign
promises
of
containing
doesnt
want
any
of
me
because
i
will
set
him
straight
always
believed
that
would
be
a
learning
opportunity
a
chance
to
share
and
for
collaboration
speculating
that
johnson
would
survive
and
how
labour
might
play
things
never
dreampt
that
would
kick
off
but
our
only
shame
should
be
if
we
fail
to
embrace
learn
work
what
does
is
for
his
country
and
peace
in
that
region
what
trudeau
does
is
silencing
canadians
through
coercion
against
his
antidemocratic
measures

i
always
refer

some

dont
seem
to
appreciate
this
appearing
in
their

column
much
to
my
surprise
reminds
me
of
appeasement
in
the
good
old
days
charlie
chaplin
would
have
loved
it
we
have
to
do
more
for
this
man
for
these
people
he
is
willing
to
die
for
his
countrys
freedom
and
selfdetermination
and
the
west
isnt
even
willing
to
kick
russia
out
of
swift
i
dont
fucking
get
it
im
sorry
in
his
next
bold
move
joe
will
be
sanctioning
s
access
to
netflix
devastating
for
sure
it
will
take
time
tho
perhaps
this
is
why
isnt
trying
too
hard
to
stop
he
wants
zelinsky
out
of
power
so
proof
of
secrets
doesnt
get
exposed
ill
not
cut
off
your
energy
resources
if
you
destroy
that
info
for
me
wink
wink
with
the
in
full
operation
it
wouldve
negated
any
opportunity
russia
wouldve
gain
from
the
invasion
of
authoritarian
powers
believe
the
moment
has
come
to
push
back
against
us
power
and
reshape
the
world
can
someone
please
explain
to
me
why
britain
and
the
nations
of
europe
cant
send
in
troopstanksjetswarships
to
fight
with
please
this
is
a
genuine
question
as
its
not
just
we
should
be
worrying
about
china
is
watching
my
thoughts
and
prayers
go
out
to
everyone
who
is
going
through
the
unimaginable
situation
in
i
hope
this
gets
resolved
as
soon
as
possible
some
things
are
bigger
than
politics
this
is
one
of
them
this
isnt
good
i
know
needs
all
the
help
they
can
get
but
accepting
these
groups
help
will
further
s
false

bombing
of
the
biolabs
in
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
request
or
is
covidian
programing
too
strong
to
think
of
anything
except
covid
you
sheep
are
pathetic
russian
bubs
could
flatten
in
a
day
if
they
wanted
to
because
theres
not
much
doesnt
already
know
about
our
military
he
had
access
to
tons
of
information
between
hes
got
taps
all
over
the
world
no
matter
how
you
put
it
heroic
but
to
all
those
fighting
i
call
on
to
please
stop
the
indiscriminate
attacks
in
we
need
peace
in
russias
acts
of
aggression
will
be
devastating
to
the
ukrainian
people
the
russian
people
the
world
add
your
name
the
us
must
work
with
international
allies
to
hold
accountable
bring
this
conflict
to
an
end
support
the
ukrainian
people
yep
the
hypocrisy
cried
babies
he
can
post
whatever
he
wants
too
and
mind
your
own
business
and
he
has
every
rights
to
speak
a
truth
so
we
are
so
nobody
cant
take
our
rights
and
freedom
away
from
us
so
deal
with
your
little
bullshit
is
the
one
fucked
up
and
look
what
he
did
stupid
shit
covid
test
available
tomorrow
at
cvs
e
mockingbird
ln
vs
russia
is
like
congress
vs
bjp
both
are
enemy
of
muslim
directly
or
indirectly
supporting
both
of
them
like
supporting
either
lesser
evil
or
greater
evil
this
may
be
the
first
time
i
have
agreed
with
a
fox
news
headline
in
my
life
does
need
to
act
tougher
stop
thinking
about
reelectiononly
thing
i
can
guess
as
to
why
they
are
afraid
to
let
gas
skyrocket
as
there
is
no
hope
for
him
anyways
focus
on
outplaying
for
added
clarity
my
mom
was
watching
the
news
and
told
me
the
only
thing
that
scares
me
more
than
covid
are
the
terrorists
coming
to
america
thats
when
i
knew
we
were
close
to
being
able
to
transition
them
out
of
the
plandemic
oh
sure
prez
historian
the
invasion
has
cause
problems
on
his
own
home
front
like
vietnam
did
for
lbj
arent
happy
with
his
invasion
and
what
would
u
do
when
s
thrown
out
off
office
then
u
dont
have
a
boogeyman
narrative
which
youre
playing
extending
a
countrys
powerinfluence
through
military
force
so
exactly
what
russia
are
doing
by
invading
nato
is
afraid
that
means
war
today
but
i
think
we
agree
that
if
no
one
stands
up
he
doesnt
stop
nato
standing
up
would
make
someone
blink
why
do
you
think
have
us
and
european
nations
invested
heavily
in
media
industries
it
is
exactly
for
such
distressed
times
these
investments
will
ensure
that
these
channels
become
hmvs
this
ia
the
reason
why
china
and
russia
has
banned
investment
in
media
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
my
dad
about
how
the
world
was
going
to
look
after
four
years
of
this
was
on
the
list
unfortunately
it
was
long
list
finnish
gov
has
not
announced
intention
to
join
nato
but
the
public
have
shown
increased
interest
into
joining
nato
coalition
facts
the
united
states
and
the
eu
must
urgently
take
action
for
abandon
the
nonsense
of
threatening
russia
with
sanctions
provide
active
air
support
and
weapons
to
the
ukrainian
army
now
get
your
asses
up
tell
me
youre
out
of
touch
and
privileged
without
telling
me
youre
out
of
touch
and
privileged
just
let
it
go
theyre
just
bombing
your
homes
nbd
vote
them
out
when
decides
democracy
is
important
president
nominates
judge
ketanji
brown
jackson
to
serve
as
associate
justice
of
the
us
supreme
court
via
sad
to
think
that
after
the
war
will
have
thousands
of
angry
citizens
who
are
mad
that
they
cant
keep
the
guns
just
in
case
they
might
need
to
use
it
against
a
fellow
ukrainian
and
the
countrys
gun
related
homicides
and
suicides
will
rise
and
the
ukrainian
people
reposed
so
much
faith
in
democracy
as
evidenced
by
their
great
resolve
to
fight
off
their
aggressors
is
the
bad
guy
in
every
scenario
coz
the
west
knows
how
to
create
narratives
to
vilify
ppl
they
dont
like
if
russia
came
into
mexico
man
asking
why
all
the
hate
and
citing
how
he
has
aided
past
liberation
movements
against
us
imperialism
is
such
a
fucking
bad
take
right
now
wow
friendly
reminder
that
russia
is
a
capitalist
country
using
its
imperial
history
to
justify
ownership
of
see
s
speech
denazification
is
the
excuse
of
a
farright
autocrat
playing
on
wwii
history
to
install
a
new
government
indeed
complete
respect
for
zalenskyy
remaining
to
the
end
is
essential
for
morale
and
continued
resistance
the
fact
that
he
and
poroshenko
are
both
visibly
present
and
resolved
is
massively
important

i
know
how
of
your
ukie

at

now
they
have
a

im
sorry
for
being
ia
but
theres
so
many
painful
informations
lately
about
honest
question
how
do
you
get
those
supplies
to
them
without
being
accused
of
being
actual
combatants
i
mean
we
all
have
the
responsibility
to
counter
russian
propaganda
vigorously
they
are
highly
skilled
and
hyperaggressive
in
their
disinformation
campaigns
we
must
replace
every
single
lie
in

the

part
also
the
southern
belrusian
force
that
took
chernobyl
is
gonna
pincer
on
the

if
its
not
taken
by
the
time
they
arrive
i
wonder
if
theyrd
redirect
east
chernobyl
really
is
a

to
so
much
so
it

why
they

they

i
dont

my

now
mitch
mcconnells
got
some
nerve
trying

slow
down
the

as
he
put

faster
than
anyone
in

of

mitch
mcconnell
hes
a
lowlife
coward
of
a

how
old
were
you
when
you
started
your
twitter
account
there
really
isnt
any
excuse
for
you
to
have
had
that
thing
since
the
war
in
was
started
by
america
when
us
installed
a
puppet
regime
in
awaiting
test
results
but
partner

i
seem
to
definitely
have
covid
she
has
a
wild
dry

though
he
does
give
credits
to
the
individuals
he
deemed
to
find
interesting
alas
where
he
was
settled
on
a
nice

soon
was

they
didnt

the

were
mostly
from

the

is
misleading
withheld

that
was
later
released
so
got
the
lethal
military
aid
if
your
point
is
that
s
is
bad
for
a
potential

i
was
trying
to
think
of
what
russian
products
ive
purchased
in
my
life
that
i
could
name
the
only
thing
i
came
up
with
is
a

baltika
from
the
lcbo
two
years
ago
unfettered
humanitarian
aid
now
left
alone
to
fight
with
dt
countries
this
is
the
result
of
the
expansion
of
nato
probably
to
demoralize
russian
troops
eu
and
us
should
buy
copious
amounts
of

while
the

is
low
and
then
block
swift

while

but
whatever
no

whatsoever
this

national

much
more
important
than

thats

thats

would
have
loved
to
see

put

i

it
was
theres

columbus
just
found
america
and
showed
it
to
europe
cuz
the
vikings
wouldnt
the
opinion
of
the

anymore
your

influencial
country
in
europe
nd
in

to
th
in
europe
rd
in

overnight
why
would
even
bother
influencing
our

now
truth
isnato
surrounds
russia
in
s
eyes
thats
a
threat
of
a
potential

if
russia

basically
just
said
that
is
the
new
a
lot
of
live
in
the
west
they
need
to
speak
up
on
social

phone
home
tell
those
in
what
is
really
happening
russian
athletes
celebrities
need
to
use
their

and
speak
out
against

the

need
you
to
get
through
to

i
just
heard
from
one
of

in
my

sasha
fight

in

oh
well
would
ya
look
at
that
found
his
black

he
said
he
would
be
specifically
looking
to
use
i
mean
nominate
isnt
it
just
great
we
judge
by
skin
color
now
not
skill
ah
the
leftist
utopia
nowadays
i
hear
only
people
talking
about
russia
invasion
but
no
one
is
willing
to
help
physically
or
financially
if
you
are
truly
care
and
have
the
human
in
you
youll
help
otherwise
shame
on
all
of
us
if
we
cant
help
now
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
all
sounds
very
logical
and
if
hadnt
been
planning
this
for
years
supporters
s
gather
outside
we
knew
this
would
happen
warfare
has
again
transformed
to
match
with
the
realities
of
technology
for
someone
may
have
told
them
about
his
golden

experience
and
always
bragged
about
moscow
prostitutes
being
the

americas
got
talent
clown
show
psaki
says
didnt
mean
comment
that
no
one
expected
the

to
prevent
anything
from
happeningit
was
the
teleprompters
fault
and
his
mouth
cant
read
will
get
to

this

get
very
far
icc
prosecutor
pushes
for
full
investigation
into
war
crimes
no
question
at
all
the
winds
have
shifted
is
weak
humm
one
china
policy
is
an
foundation
of
the
relationship
between
china
and
all
countries
i
just
signed
a
petition
breaking
selects
judge
ketanji
brown
jackson
demand
a
fair
hearing
sign
here
the
idea
that
covid
deaths
need
to
match
excess
deaths
is
a
bit
misguided
full
suport
for
the
proposal
of
and
many
others
on
excluding
russia
from
strong
sanctions
should
indeed
mean
deterrent
measures
the
next
step
of
russia
is
already
here
ie
threats
against
finland
and
sweden
russia
is
less
and
less
scared
of
western
sanctions
because
chinas
got
more
reserves
than
any
country
in
the
world
probably
in
aggregate
more
reserves
than
every
country
in
the
world
matthew

clearly

unfortunately
viruses
evolve
faster
than
human
immune
systems
we
need
either
to
have
a
disease
or
to
be
vaccinated
against
it
to
become
immunized
with
some
diseases
the
immunity
lasts
longer
but
covid
is
mutating
too
quickly
what
worked
well
up
to
delta
works
less
on
omicron
restrict
this
is
an
insane
covid
policy
every
other
major
venue
much
larger
in
size
allows
for
proof
of
negative
covid
test
for
entry
you
do
understand
you
can
be
covid
positive
while
vaccinated
and
proof
of
a

covid
test

russia
shouldnt

no
thats
just
it
western

is
not

only
china

doesnt
that
interest
you
why
do
they
do
that
ask
yourself
that

just
what
advice
does
the

have
for
responding

you
ask

did
she
say
has
she
received
any

sometimes
its
ok
not

say
what
youre
thinking
i
am
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
contributing
factors
it
seems
to
me
that
not
being
a
member
of
nato
might
unfortunately
be
beneficial
to
a
lot
of
people
a
nuke
power
like
the
us
being
mandated
to
fight
boots
on
the
ground
alongside
with
nuke
power

avoided

last
night
aired
a
repeat
of
episode
of
our
awardwinning
series
a
russian
spy
story
essential
viewing
in
light
of
recent
events
you
can
watch
all
three
parts
on
all
here
problem
with
that
statement
is
the
context
of
multiple
shows
over
several
weeks
in
which
he
all
but
justified
what
is
doing
namibian
compatriots
and
students
in
our
prayers
are
with
you
we
think
of
the
suffering
and
exigent
circumstances
you
are
confronting
my
office
is
seeking
solutions
from
all
important
offices
in
our
land
stay
strong
l
the
treaty
of
in
and
at
budapest
memorandum
to
protect
was
that
the
and
will
protect
now
who
will
protect
article
china
is
a
russian
ally
as
is
iran
would
never
had
invaded
with
out
arrangements
st
made
w
red
china
chinas
rhetoric
about
interference
in
sovereign
matters
only
applies
to
its
own
human
rights
violations
desire
to
seize
taiwan
contra
asesinos
como
a
humans
greed
is
the
deadliest
thing
on
earth
i
swear
russian
presidents
seem
to
want
nothing
more
than
to
take
more
land
and
spread
communism
would
seek
alliance
that
can
provide
them
military
assistance
in
case
their
countrys
security
is
threatened
but
then
again

russian
fm
has
condemned
the
west
for
their
unwavering
defence
of
the
ukrainian
regime
and
turning
a
blind
eye
to
its
war
crimes
against
civilians
in
the
countrys
east
lets
put
in
usa
words
shipping
carriers
are
delaying
and
refusing
to
transport
goods
china
pays
shipping
carriers
so
much
money
to
export
chinesemade
goods
that
they
are
paid
a
premium
to
carry
empty
containers
from
america
back
to
china
you
guys
see
the
market
just
proof
of
how
much
we
really
care
about
whats
happening
in
a
typical
example
of
mindef
using
the
scenario
of
battalion
to
attack
company
sized
enemies
ratio
seems
about
right
from
russian
numbers
simply
stated
mate
i
genuinely
hope
so
if
this
is
a
tyrannical
dictator
as
hes
been
described
and
we
can
trust
our
governments
then
im
happy
doesnt
help
those
in
and
russia
and
it
doesnt
help
the
bloodshed
but
i
would
like
to
be
able
trust
our
leaders
i
am
not
palestinian
he
was
fired
for
not
doing
his
job
well
enough
this
is
easily
researched
and
wtf
does
that
have
to
do
with
supporting
right
now
it
is
possible
to
pull
your
head
out
of
tucker
carlsons
ass
